    What is Mental Health?
</h1>

<p>
    Mental health refers to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being. It is all about how people think, feel, and behave. People sometimes use the term “mental health” to mean the absence of a mental disorder.

    Mental health can affect daily living, relationships, and physical health.

    However, this link also works in the other direction. Factors in people’s lives, interpersonal connections, and physical factors can all contribute to mental health disruptions.

    Looking after mental health can preserve a person’s ability to enjoy life. Doing this involves reaching a balance between life activities, responsibilities, and efforts to achieve psychological resilience.

    Conditions such as stress, depression, and anxiety can all affect mental health and disrupt a person’s routine. </p>

<h1>What is Depression? & Symptoms of Depression</h1>

<img class = "float-right" src= "Signs-and-Symptoms-of-Depression-731x1024.png" alt="Signs of depression" width="550" height="545">

<p> Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home.

    Depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Feeling sad or having a depressed mood</li>
        <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed</li>
        <li>Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting</li>
        <li>Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much</li>
        <li>Loss of energy or increased fatigue</li>
        <li>Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., inability to sit still, pacing, handwringing) or slowed movements or speech (these actions must be severe enough to be observable by others)</li>
        <li>Feeling worthless or guilty</li>
        <li>Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions</li>
        <li>Thoughts of death or suicide</li>
      </ul>

    
<h1>Why specifically mental health in African Americans?</h1>
<p>
    The myths and stigma that surround depression create needless pain and confusion, and can keep people from getting proper treatment. The following statements reflect some common misconceptions about Black Americans and depression “Why are you depressed? If our people could make it through slavery, we can make it through anything.” “When a black woman suffers from a mental disorder, the opinion is that she is weak. And weakness in black women is intolerable.” “You should take your troubles to Jesus, not some stranger/psychiatrist.”The truth is that getting help is a sign of strength. People with depression can’t just “snap out of it.” Also, spiritual support can be an important part of healing, but the care of a qualified mental health professional is essential. And the earlier treatment begins, the more effective it can be.

<p>
    Anyone can experience clinical depression, regardless of race, gender, age, creed or income. Every year more than 19 million Americans suffer from some type of depressive illness. According to a Surgeon General report, Black Americans are over-represented in populations that are particularly at risk for mental illness. Depression robs people of the enjoyment found in daily life and can even lead to suicide. A common myth about depression is that it is “normal” for certain people to feel depressed—older people, teenagers, new mothers, menopausal women, or those with a chronic illness. The truth is that depression is not a normal part of life for any Black American, regardless of age or life situation. Unfortunately, depression has often been misdiagnosed in the Black community. </p>
